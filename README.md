# IAR Build Tools in a Jenkins CI

>[!WARNING]
>The information in this repository is subject to change without notice and does not constitute a commitment by IAR. While it serves as a valuable reference for DevOps Engineers implementing Continuous Integration with IAR Tools, IAR assumes no responsibility for any errors, omissions, or specific implementations.

## Introduction
The [IAR Build Tools](https://iar.com/bx) comes with everything you need to build projects created with the IAR Embedded Workbench from the command line. [Jenkins][url-jenkins] is an automation controller suitable for CI (Continuous Integration). [Gitea][url-gitea] is a lightweight Git server. 

This tutorial provides a quick method for bootstrapping the IAR Build Tools, Gitea and Jenkins, each one on its own container, for building and analyzing your embedded projects on-premises. From this starting point, you can apply customizations suitable for your organization's needs.

## Pre-requisites
__For completing this tutorial you need to have the Docker image with the IAR Build Tools from the [__bx-docker__][url-bx-docker] tutorial.__

You will also need a web browser to access webpages. It is assumed that the web browser is installed on a Windows PC in which you have privileges to execute administrative tasks and that can reach the Linux server containing the Docker daemon with the IAR Build Tools.

In the Linux server's shell, clone this repository to the user's home directory (`~`):
```
git clone https://github.com/iarsystems/bx-jenkins-ci.git ~/bx-jenkins-ci
```

## Setting up a Docker Network
For simplifying this setup let's create a [docker network][url-docker-docs-net] named __jenkins__ in the Linux server's shell:
```
docker network create jenkins
```
From here onwards, we spawn all the tutorial's containers with `--network-alias <name> --network jenkins` so that they become visible and reacheable from each other.

As administrator, edit the __%WINDIR%/system32/drivers/etc/hosts__ file in the Windows PC. Add the following line, replacing `192.168.1.2` by the actual Linux server's IP address. With that, the Windows PC can reach the containers' exposed service ports by their respective network-alias names:
```
192.168.1.2 gitea jenkins
```

<img alt="Gitea" align="right" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12724356?s=84&v=4"/><br>

## Setting up Gitea
Now it is time to setup the __gitea__ container. On the Linux server's shell, execute:
```
docker run \
  --name gitea \
  --network jenkins \
  --network-alias gitea \
  --detach \
  --restart=unless-stopped \
  --volume gitea-data:/data \
  --volume /etc/timezone:/etc/timezone:ro \
  --volume /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
  --publish 3000:3000 \
  --publish 2222:2222 \
  gitea/gitea:1.22.1
```

A webhook is a mechanism which can be used to trigger associated build jobs in Jenkins whenever, for example, code is pushed into a Git repository.

Update `/data/gitea/conf/app.ini` for accepting webhooks from the __jenkins__ container:
```
docker exec gitea bash -c "echo -e '\n[webhook]\nALLOWED_HOST_LIST=jenkins\nDISABLE_WEBHOOKS=false' >> /data/gitea/conf/app.ini"
docker restart gitea
```

On the web browser, navigate to http://gitea:3000 to perform the initial Gitea setup:
- Make sure __Server Domain__ is set to `gitea`.
- Make sure __Gitea Base URL__ is set to `http://gitea:3000`.
- Unfold __Administrator Account Settings__.
   - Set the __Administrator Username__ (suggested: `jenkins`)
   - Set the __Email Address__
   - Set the __Password__
   - Set the __Confirm Password__
- Click __`Install Gitea`__.

>[!NOTE]
>These configuration options will be written into `/data/gitea/conf/app.ini` stored inside the `gitea-data` volume.

### Generating an access token
Instead of using the Gitea administrator account credentials outside its container, it is recommended to use a personal access token so that jenkins can access the repository without the need of using Gitea's administrative credentials.

To generate a new token in the user profile settings:
- Go to __Applications__ → __Generate New Token__ ([http://gitea:3000/user/settings/applications](http://gitea:3000/user/settings/applications)).
- Choose a __Token Name__ (suggestion: `Jenkins Token`).
- Select the following permissions:
   - __issue__: `Read and Write`
   - __notification__: `Read and Write`
   - __organization__: `Read and Write`
   - __packages__: `Read`
   - __repository__: `Read and Write`
   - __user__: `Read and Write`
- click on __Generate Token__.

> [!TIP]
> You can generate as many access tokens as you need however, when generating a new token, make sure to copy it when shown in the next page. It will never be shown again.

### Example by migrating an existing repository
On the top-right corner of the page:
- Go to __`+`__ → __New Migration__ → __GitHub__ (http://gitea:3000/repo/migrate?service_type=2). 
- __Migrate / Clone from URL__: [`https://github.com/iarsystems/bx-workspaces-ci`](https://github.com/iarsystems/bx-workspaces-ci).
- Edit the [Jenkinsfile](http://gitea:3000/jenkins/bx-workspaces-ci/_edit/master/Jenkinsfile)
   - update the __agent__ settings to match the __image__ you created earlier when performing the [bx-docker](https://github.com/iarsystems/bx-docker) guide.

## Setting up Jenkins
It is finally time to set up the __jenkins__ container.

The standard Jenkins setup has a number of steps that can be automated with the [configuration-as-code][url-plugin-casc] plugin. For this, let's use a custom [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) that will:
* use the __jenkins/jenkins:lts-slim__ as base image, a stable version offering __LTS__ (Long-Term Support).
* use the __configuration-as-code__ plugin, so that we script the initial Jenkins [configuration](jcasc.yaml).
* use the `jenkins-plugin-cli` command line utility to install a collection of [plugins](plugins.txt) versions that are known to be working.
* and more... (check [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) for details).

>[!NOTE]
>Given its fast-paced and complex ecosystem, Jenkins' plugins sometimes might break compatibility regarding its interdependencies. For such reasons, if you try this tutorial at a point in time where a certain plugin prevents the Docker image from being created, it is possible to pin the broken plugin's version by replacing `<broken-plugin>:latest` for a plugin's earlier version in the `plugin.txt` file. 

Build the image, tagging it as __jenkins:jcasc__:
```
docker build --tag jenkins:jcasc --build-arg DOCKER_GROUP=$(getent group docker | cut -d: -f3) ~/bx-jenkins-ci
```

Now run the __jenkins__ container:
> [!NOTE]
> Edit `JENKINS_ADMIN_ID` and `JENKINS_ADMIN_PASSWORD` for running with credentials other than `admin`/`password` for the Jenkins' administrative user.
```
docker run --name jenkins \
  --network jenkins \
  --network-alias jenkins \
  --detach \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --env JENKINS_ADMIN_ID=admin \
  --env JENKINS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password \
  --privileged \
  --publish 8080:8080 \
  --publish 50000:50000 \
  --volume jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home \
  --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  jenkins:jcasc
```

### Setting up the Docker Cloud plugin
It is time to configure the [__docker-cloud__][url-plugin-docker-cloud] plugin. In your web browser:

- Navigate to [http://jenkins:8080](http://jenkins:8080).
- Log in as "administrator" (e.g., `admin`).
- Go to __Configure a cloud →__.
- Select __New cloud__ → __Docker__. [http://jenkins:8080/cloud/new](http://jenkins:8080/cloud/new)
- Name it `Jenkins cloud` and hit __`  Create  `__.

In the _New cloud_ page:
- Unfold __Docker Cloud details__.
- Fill __Docker Host URI__ with `unix:///var/run/docker.sock`
- Click __` Test Connection `__. You should get an output similar to: `Version = 27.1.0, API Version = 1.46`.
- Tick the __Enabled__ checkbox and, down below, click the ` Save ` button.

### Setting up the Gitea plugin
To configure the [__gitea__][url-plugin-gitea] plugin proceed as follows, starting from the Jenkins Dashboard (http://jenkins:8080):
- Go to __Manage Jenkins__.
- Go to __System__ under the "System Configuration" section (http://jenkins:8080/manage/configure).
- Scroll down to __Gitea Servers__ and click ` Add ` → __Gitea Server__.
- Name it (e.g.) "Gitea Server".
- Set __Server URL__ to `http://gitea:3000`. You should see `Gitea Version: 1.22.1` as response.
- Enable the __Manage hooks__ checkbox. This will allow Jenkins to manage the [webhooks][url-gitea-docs-webhooks] for the Gitea server.
   - ` Add ` a new __Jenkins__ (global) credential.
   - Change its "Kind" to __Gitea Personal Access Token__.
   - Paste the Gitea access token created during the Gitea server setup.
   - Give it a __Description__ (e.g. "Jenkins Token"), click __` Add `__.
 
>[!NOTE]
>You should see _Hook management will be performed as `jenkins`_ or the corresponding Gitea user.

- Click __` Save `__.

### Creating an Organization Folder
Go back to the Jenkins Dashboard (http://jenkins:8080):

- Click __New Item__.
- __Enter an item name__ (e.g. `Organization`).
- Select __Organization Folder__ and click __` OK `__.

In the __Configuration__ page:
- Select __Projects__ → "Repository Sources" → __` Add `__ → __Gitea Organization__.
- Select the "Jenkins Token" from the __Credentials__ drop-down list.
- Fill the __Owner__ field with the username you created for your Gitea server (e.g., `jenkins`) and __` Save `__.


## What happens next?
After that, Jenkins will use its multi-branch scan plugin to retrieve all the project repositories available on the Gitea Server.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/255fdef5-d29d-480d-93fb-d8c9aadd0a4d)

When a project repository contains a [Jenkinsfile](https://github.com/IARSystems/bx-workspaces-ci/blob/master/Jenkinsfile) that uses a [declarative pipeline](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/), Jenkins will then automatically execute the pipeline.

When the pipeline requests a Docker agent for the __docker-cloud__ plugin, it will automatically forward the request to the __jenkins__ container so a new container based on the selected image is dynamically spawned during the workflow execution.
```groovy
pipeline {
  agent {
    docker {
      image 'iarsystems/bx<package>:<version>' 
      args '...'
  }
/* ... */
  stage('Build project') {
     steps {
       sh '/opt/iarsystems/bx<package>/common/bin/iarbuild project.ewp -build Release -log all'
      }
/* ... */
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/130c6365-e205-4ecd-baaf-6c0b2e80e503)


Jenkins will get a push notification from Gitea (via webhooks) whenever a monitored event is generated on the __owner__'s repositories.

Now you can start developing using the [IAR Embedded Workbench][url-iar-ew] and committing the project's code to the Gitea Server so you get automated builds and reports.

### Highlights
* The [__warnings-ng__][url-plugin-warnings-ng] plugin gives instantaneous feedback for every build on compiler-generated warnings as well violation warnings on coding standards provided by [IAR C-STAT](https://www.iar.com/cstat), our static code analysis tool for C/C++:

![warnings-ng-cstat](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50138a98-8768-4d47-af58-f29a241bfb36)


* The [__gitea-checks__][url-plugin-gitea-checks] plugin has integrations with the [__warnings-ng__][url-plugin-warnings-ng] plugin. On the Gitea server, it can help you to spot failing checks on pull requests, preventing potentially defective code from being inadvertently merged into a project's production branch:

> [!NOTE]
> Jenkins provides plugins for many other Git server providers such as GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket. Although these services also offer their own CI infrastructure and runners. Gitea was picked for this tutorial for its simplicity to deploy in a container. Refer to [Managing Jenkins/Managing Plugins][url-jenkins-docs-plugins] for further details.


## Summary
This tutorial provides a quickly deployable and reproducible setup where everything runs on containers. This is just one of many ways to set up automated workflows using the IAR Build Tools. By using [Jenkins Configuration as Code][url-jenkins-jcasc] fto set up a new Jenkins controller, you can simplify the initial configuration with YAML syntax. This configuration can be validated and reproduced across other Jenkins controllers.
   
You can learn from the provided scripts, [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) and official [Jenkins Documentation][url-jenkins-docs]. Together, these resources form a cornerstone for your organization, allowing you to use them as-is or customize them to ensure the containers run in ways that meet your specific needs.
